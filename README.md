This is the first Challenge in my Full Stack Development boot camp. In this assignment, I took all of the <div> semantics and changed them to more specific HTML semantics, EX: <aside> <figure> etc. I then made the according changed in the CSS file while cleaning up addition factors related to the HTML. This assignment really helped me understand the concept of semantic labels in a real world setting.
